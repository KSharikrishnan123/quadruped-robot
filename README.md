# quadruped-robot
This project focuses on the development of a kinematics-based motion model of a quadruped robot and controlling it over a simulation environment. analyzing the robot kinematics, deriving the motion model in the pybullet physics engine along with demonstrating the URDF processes will be the primary objective of the research.
